# A powerful and structured CFEngine framework

[CFEngine 3](http://www.cfengine.com) is a powerful configuration management tool that's speed, small footprint, multi-platform support, network resilience and agent-based approach attract many.

However, many have a hard time with the language and tooling, and need an easier way. CFEngine has been [described](https://digitalelf.net/2013/04/a-case-study-in-cfengine-layout/) as flour, eggs, milk and butter: all the ingredients needed to make a cake, but no recipe. __ncf__ is that missing recipe - and much more.

ncf is a framework that runs in __pure CFEngine language__, to help __structure__ your CFEngine policy and provide __reusable, single purpose components__ distributed under the __GPLv3__ license.

## Example

Since an example is worth a thousand words, here goes. This is a sample config written using ncf:

    :::cfengine3
    bundle agent ntp {
      methods:
        "package" usebundle  => package_install("ntp");
        "config"  usebundle  => file_from_template("ntp.conf", "/etc/ntp.conf");
        "reload"  usebundle  => service_restart("ntp"),
                  ifvarclass => "file_from_template__etc_ntp_conf_repaired";
        "running" usebundle  => service_ensure_running("ntp");
    }

This example will:

  - ensure the "ntp" package is installed
  - ensure the /etc/ntp.conf file is up to date from a template
  - restart ntpd if the configuration file is changed (the class "file_from_template__etc_ntp_conf_repaired" is automatically defined by the previous bundle)
  - ensure the "ntp" service is running

That's all you need to write. This will ensure configuration reaches the desired state, and output reports on anything changed.

## Philosophy

ncf is designed with the following concepts throughout:

  - __DRY__: You should never have to duplicate promises, or even promise patterns. This is the best way to make unmaintanable code.
  - __KISS__: Keep everything Simple and Sweet :) This extends to having one bundle do one thing, but do it well. Avoid complexity.
  - __Minimal effort__: Reduce typing and syntax effort for everyday use as much as possible. Make the framework do the heavy lifting - code once, benefit forever! (aka "Lazy" :) )
  - __Intuitive__: Reading and writing configuration management rules with ncf should be self-evident. Clearly named bundles and conventions make this easy.
  - __Extensible__: You should be able to extend anything, add methods or support for new tools easily, without breaking anything.
  - __Open source__: We believe in sharing so that the world can build on each other's work, and continually improve. ncf is [distributed under the GPLv3 license on GitHub](https://github.com/normation/ncf/).

## Decoupled layers

There are several layers in this framework, from 10 to 60, where each layer is a foundation for higher levels. The higher the lever, the higher the abstraction level.

  - __10_ncf_internals__: This directory contains the mechanics and glue to make the framework work. This should be very rarely modified, and is generic.
  - __20_cfe_basics__: This directory contains libraries that can be reused; most notably the CFEngine Standard Library.
  - __30_generic_methods__: This directory contains reusable bundles, that perform unit tasks, and are completely generic (for example "file_create_symlink"). All generic methods are documented on the [reference page](http://www.ncf-project.org/pages/reference.html).
  - __40_it_ops_knowledge__: This directory contains default values for services, like package names for a specific service across different distributions (aka "is it httpd or apache2?"), paths to binaries, default configuration values for services, etc.
  - __50_techniques__: This directory contains Techniques, which combine generic_methods and it_ops_knowledge to achieve system configurations you need. They may be generic ("Configure OpenSSH server") or specific ("Install and configure our in-house app"). The above example is a "technique".
  - __60_services__: This directory contains high-level service definitions, which it implements by calling individual techniques, with parameters and conditions. This level is specific for each organisation, and is intended to define services such as "Corporate web site" rather than "Apache config".

Each level uses items from lower levels (lower numbers) or, in some cases, from its own level.

## Requirements

There are none, other than CFEngine itself. ncf currently supports CFEngine 3.10 and higher.

ncf is a pure-CFEngine framework, so you can just add it in your CFEngine policy files. Nothing else is needed.

Some tooling is provided (ncf CLI), but it is not mandatory. It is designed to help developing your policy. All tooling is in Python (requires Python 2.6+).

## Getting started

Start by downloading ncf from our [Download](http://www.ncf.io/pages/download.html) page.

Then, check out the [reference documentation](http://www.ncf.io/pages/reference.html) that lists all available generic_methods.

We'd love to hear your feedback about ncf, please get in touch on IRC (#ncf on Freenode)!

# @parameter version_comparator  Comparator between installed version and defined version, can be ==,<=,>=,<,>,!=
# @parameter package_version     The version of the package to verify (can be "latest" for latest version)
# @parameter action              Action to perform, can be add, verify (defaults to verify)
# @parameter update_policy       While verifying packages, check against latest version ("true") or just installed ("false")

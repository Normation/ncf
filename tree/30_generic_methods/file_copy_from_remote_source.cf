# @name File copy from remote source
# @description This is a bundle to ensure that a file or directory is copied from a remote source
# @documentation *Note*: This method uses CFEngine file copy protocol, and can only download files from
# the policy server. To download a file from an external source, you can use
# HTTP with the [file_download](#file_download) method.
# 
# This method requires that the policy server is configured to accept
# copy of the source file from the agents it will be applied to.
# 
# 
# You have to write the full path of the file on the policy server, for example:
# ```
# /home/myuser/myfile
# ```
# 
# If you are using Rudder, you can download a file from the shared files with:
# ```
# /var/rudder/configuration-repository/shared-files/PATH_TO_YOUR_FILE
# ```
#
# @parameter source      Source file 
# @parameter destination Destination file
# 
# @class_prefix file_copy_from_remote_source
# @class_parameter destination

bundle agent file_copy_from_remote_source(source, destination)

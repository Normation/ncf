# @name Package state
# @agent_version >=3.7
# @description Enforce the state of a package
# @documentation These methods manage packages using a package manager on the system.
#
# `package_present` and `package_absent` use a new package implementation, different from `package_install_*`,
# `package_remove_*` and `package_verify_*`. It should be more reliable, and handle upgrades better.
# It is compatible though, and you can call generic methods from both implementations on the same host.
# The only drawback is that the agent will have to maintain double caches for package lists, which
# may cause a little unneeded overhead.
# 
# #### Setup
#
# If you are using ncf inside Rudder, no specific setup is necessary.
#
# If your are using ncf without Rudder, you need to call the `initialization` bundle
# before using package methods.
# 
# #### Package parameters
# 
# There is only one mandatory parameter, which is the package name to install.
# When it should be installed from a local package, you need to specify the full path to the package as name.
# 
# The version parameter allows specifying a version you want installed.
# It should be the complete versions string as used by the used package manager.
# This parameter allows two special values:
# 
# * *any* which is the default value, and is satisfied by any version of the given package
# * *latest* which will ensure, at each run, that the package is at the latest available version.
# 
# The last parameter is the provider, which is documented in the next section.
#
# You can use [package_state_options](#package_state_options) to pass options to the underlying package manager
# (currently only with *apt* package manager).
#
# #### Package providers
# 
# This method supports several package managers. You can specify the package manager
# you want to use or let the method choose the default for the local system.
# 
# The package providers include a caching system for package information.
# The package lists (installed, available and available updates) are only updated
# when the cache expires, or when an operation is made by the agent on packages.
#
# *Note*: The implementation of package operations is done in scripts called modules,
# which you can find in `${sys.workdir}/modules/packages/`.
# 
# ##### apt
# 
# This package provider uses *apt*/*dpkg* to manage packages on the system.
# *dpkg* will be used for all local actions, and *apt* is only needed to manage update and
# installation from a repository.
# 
# ##### rpm
# 
# This package provider uses *yum*/*rpm* to manage packages on the system. *rpm* will 
# be used for all local actions, and *yum* is only needed to manage update and
# installation from a repository.
# 
# It is able to downgrade packages when specifying an older version.
#
# ##### zypper
# 
# This package provider uses *zypper*/*rpm* to manage packages on the system.
# *rpm* will be used for all local actions, and *zypper* is only needed to manage update and
# installation from a repository.
# 
# ##### pkg
# 
# This package provider uses FreeBSD's *pkg* to manage packages on the system.
# 
# #### Examples
# 
# ```
# # To install postgresql in version 9.1 for x86_64 atchitecture
# package_present("postgresql", "9.1", "x86_64", "");
# # To ensure postgresql is always in the latest available version
# package_present("postgresql", "latest", "", "");
# # To ensure installing postgresql in any version
# package_present("postgresql", "", "", "");
# # To ensure installing postgresql in any version, forcing the yum provider
# package_present("postgresql", "", "", "yum");
# # To ensure installing postgresql from a local package
# package_present("/tmp/postgresql-9.1-1.x86_64.rpm", "", "", "");
# # To remove postgresql
# package_absent("postgresql", "", "", "");
# ```
# 
# See also : [package_present](#package_present), [package_absent](#package_absent), [package_state_options](#package_state_options)
# @parameter name Name of the package, or path to a local package if state is present
# @parameter version Version of the package, can be "latest" for latest version or "any" for any version (defaults to "any")
# @parameter_constraint version "allow_empty_string" : true
# @parameter architecture Architecture of the package, can be an architecture name  or "default" (defaults to "default")
# @parameter_constraint architecture "allow_empty_string" : true
# @parameter provider Package provider to use, can be "yum", "apt", "zypper", "pkg" or "default" for system default package manager (defaults to "default")
# @parameter_constraint provider "allow_empty_string" : true
# @parameter_constraint provider "select" : [ "", "default", "yum", "apt", "zypper", "pkg" ]
# @parameter state State of the package, can be "present" or "absent" (defaults to "present")
# @parameter_constraint state "allow_empty_string" : true
# @parameter_constraint state "select" : [ "", "present", "absent" ]
# 
# @class_prefix package_state
# @class_parameter name
